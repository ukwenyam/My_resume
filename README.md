How to host your jekyll themed resume on Github Pages.

## Getting Started

These set of instructions will give you a step by step process of successfully hosting a Resume website styled with a Github jekyll theme, and hosted on Github pages.

### Description of Intended Audience

This instruction set is described for individuals who have never used Github or Github Pages before. You do not need to know a whole lot about Github or Jekyll to get this working.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* To begin, you'll need a markdown editor on your computer to edit your resume in.
 *  A great example of a markdown editor is Atom.

* You'll also need a Github account.


### Installing

Let's get things started by making sure we have all the software we'll to get this done.
* First we need to install the Atom editor. If you don't already have it installed on your computer, begin by going to this link [Download Atom editor](http://www.atom.io)
* Click on the  Download button to begin downloading Atom.

Say what the step will be

### Getting Github setup

If you don't already have an active Github account, don't sweat it. These instructions will guide you to setting up your Github account and creating the repository needed to host your website on Github Pages.
* First head over to [github.com](http://www.github.com).
* Just like signing up for a facebook profile, fill out the information needed to create an account and click on the "Sign up for Github" button
* The following page talks about picking a personal plan for your account. The majority of your work on github you would want to be public. So select the unlimited  public repositories for free
![Unlimited free](http://github.com/ukwenyam/UkwenyaMichael.github.io/raw/master/Images/freeRepos.png)
and then click on "Continue".
* On the next page, you can go ahead and start a new Project by clicking "Start a Project".
* There might be a message about verifying your email address. If you do get this message, go ahead and verify you email before proceeding with the remaining steps.
* After verifying your email, proceed to start a new project.

### Creating a repository

After getting Your Github account up and running, you want to actually start getting stuff on there. One way to do this is by creating repositories and uploading files, Documents, Pictures whatever it is you would like to share on your Github.
* Click on the little cat-like image on the top left corner (Github logo) ![github logo](http://github.com/ukwenyam/UkwenyaMichael.github.io/raw/master/Images/githublogo.png).
* Select the 'New' button next to 'Repositories' to create a new repository.
* Give your repository name which will be the name of the website you're trying to host on Github Pages.
* Feel free to add a description of what the repository is created for
* Next select the 'Initialize this repository with a README option'.
![Initialize Readme](http://github.com/ukwenyam/UkwenyaMichael.github.io/raw/master/Images/initializeREADME.png)
* Finally click on Create repository, and Github will get your repository up and running.
If this is your first repository then
 **Congratulations you just created your first Github repository**. If this is not your first repository, then **Way to go being productive!!**

### Instructions

Now you've downloaded and installed your markdown editor, and also created your first repository on your Github account.
What you'll need now is to format your resume in markdown with the editor you just installed. Don't worry about formatting the document with a jekyll theme just yet, we'll handle that later.
* Before you can upload your markdown file on Github, you will need to connect your Atom editor to your Github repository.
* Head over to your Github page. Select the repository with the format 'username/repositoryname'. For me, my username is ukwenyam and my repositoryname is UkwenyaMichael.github.io, so my repository would be 'ukwenyam/UkwenyaMichael.github.io'
